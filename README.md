# LeetCode Solutions by Ankit Kumar

Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions** repository! ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of my solutions to a variety of problems from **LeetCode**, a platform known for honing problem-solving skills in the field of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms (DSA)**. I created this repository to not only improve my own coding skills but also to share my learning journey with others, with the hope that it will help anyone looking to solve LeetCode problems or enhance their problem-solving abilities.

## About
In this repository, I have organized the solutions according to the types of problems that are available on **LeetCode**. These problems cover various domains of computer science, including **arrays**, **strings**, **trees**, **graphs**, **dynamic programming**, **backtracking**, and much more!

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Solve a wide variety of problems that will enhance my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Offer a well-documented collection of solutions that help others understand different approaches to solving problems.
- Keep improving my coding skills and share the knowledge with the community.

## Solutions
The solutions here are written in **C++** and **Python** (whenever applicable). Each solution is carefully designed to address the problem efficiently, with a focus on writing clean, readable, and optimized code. Most solutions also include detailed comments and explanations to make it easier for anyone who is trying to understand the thought process behind the solution.

### Key Features:
- **Problem Descriptions**: Each problem comes with a brief description and the approach I took to solve it.
- **Code Comments**: I have added comments to explain each part of the code, which is especially helpful for those new to algorithms and data structures.
- **Optimized Solutions**: I focus on solving problems with the most efficient algorithms to improve runtime and performance.
- **Diverse Difficulty Levels**: You will find problems of varying difficulty â€” from easy to very hard â€” so you can gradually challenge yourself and improve your skills.

### Example Problem Categories:
- **Arrays**: Searching, sorting, and manipulation of arrays.
- **Strings**: String matching, transformations, and pattern searches.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and traversal algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimized solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems.
- **Linked Lists**: Manipulating linked lists and their variations.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths, and graph traversal algorithms.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problem-solving using optimal choices at each step.
- **Backtracking**: Solving problems by trying all possible solutions and backtracking when necessary.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: A powerful language that allows me to write efficient and low-level code, perfect for algorithmic problem-solving.
- **Python**: A high-level language that's easy to write and read, ideal for experimenting with solutions and trying out new ideas quickly.
- **LeetCode**: A fantastic platform for practicing coding problems and sharpening problem-solving skills.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KUMARANKIT3012/Leetcode.git
    ```
2. Explore the folder structure and browse through the different problem-solving files. Each folder represents a different category of problems (e.g., Arrays, Trees, etc.).
3. Run the corresponding C++ or Python file for each problem to see the output.
4. If you'd like to test out solutions on **LeetCode**, you can search for the problem ID (usually the number next to the problem title) and check my solutions for reference.
